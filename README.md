# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python and data analysis libraries. The system analyzes a dataset of movies, their genres, keywords, cast, and crew to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## Project Overview

- The `main.py` file contains the code for the movie recommendation system.
- The dataset used for analysis is provided in two CSV files: `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`.
- The code performs various data handling and preprocessing tasks, including merging data, handling missing values, and extracting relevant information.
- Text data preprocessing techniques such as stemming and cleaning are applied to improve the quality of movie descriptions.
- The system computes cosine similarity between movie vectors to measure similarity and generate recommendations.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Proficiency in data handling and manipulation using pandas and numpy.
- Merging and joining datasets to create a comprehensive movie database.
- Preprocessing text data to improve analysis accuracy.
- Computing cosine similarity for measuring similarity between movie vectors.
- Building a movie recommendation system based on user preferences.
